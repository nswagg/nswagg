- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nswagg

- Iâ€™m fascinated by virtual reality systems, and human-computer interfacing (HCI or BCI as it is commonly known). But not like, putting computers inside of people. I think that's kinda strange.
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Bachelor of Innovation in Computer Science degree at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, the only degree of its kind in the world. The BI program focuses on cross-disciplinary creative communication, entrepreneurship, and innovation paired tandem with the technical skills of a normal Computer Science degree
