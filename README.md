- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nswagg

- Iâ€™m fascinated by extended reality systems (virtual and augmented reality), and I help people experience the world through positive user experiences through interfacing. 
     
- ðŸŒ± I have Bachelor of Innovation in Computer Science degree at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, the only degree of its kind in the world. The BI program focuses on cross-disciplinary creative communication, entrepreneurship, and innovation paired tandem with the technical skills of a normal Computer Science degree
