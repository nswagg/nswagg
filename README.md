- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nswagg

- Iâ€™m fascinated by virtual reality systems, computer vision, and human-computer interfacing (HCI or BCI as it is commonly known). But not like, putting computers inside of people. I think that's kinda strange.
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my undergraduate in the College of Innovation at University of Colorado Colorado Springs
     studying Computer Science and beginning to delve into Software Engineering.
     
- ðŸ“« Visit nswagg.com for more information and contact.

Honestly, I'm surprised my About Me doesn't have any bugs...
