- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nswagg

- Iâ€™m interested in smart systems and Human-Machine Interactions and Interfacing: How humans and computers bridge the gap to create positive
     in everything from website navigation to medical equipment, and smartphone apps; every application has a different "interaction pattern"
     
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my undergraduate in the College of Innovation at University of Colorado Colorado Springs
     studying Computer Science and beginning to delve in to Data Analysis and Software Engineering (DASE)

Honestly, I'm surprised my About Me doesn't have any bugs...
